KonamiCodeListener
-----------------

motivation:
		I made this to be included in other projects as for eastereggs
usage:
	 1. download the jar from the downloads section
	 2. put in your projects buildpath
	 3. import com.github.midday.kcl.KonamiCodeListener;
	 4. just extend it like the normal KeyAdapter
	!5. Overwrite the startSecret method
